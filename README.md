# Carver Edison Coding Challenge

An events app deployed to https://carver-edison-coding-challenge.herokuapp.com!

## Setting up

* `npm install` (or `yarn install`)
* `npm run start:dev`

The `run start:dev` command will run both the `webpack` process (in watch mode) to build you client-side javascript files, and the Node process for your server with `nodemon`.
